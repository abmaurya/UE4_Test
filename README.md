The project is an assignment done for Innovana Thinklabs Pvt. Ltd. as an interview process.

Objectives:
1. Change colour of a pawn while it moves.
2. Teleport pawn.

The project completed both the ojectives together, in the same map. Map shows a simple cube mesh with coloured checkered texture, left-clicking on any colour makes the pawn move to that 'chequer'(square) and change its colour match to that of square where you click(and the pawn moves). Right click does the same thing except it teleports instead of translating/moving (no intermediate steps are visible, the pawn 'jumps' to the new position of the clicked square).
